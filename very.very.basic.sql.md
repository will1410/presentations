# Very Very Basic SQL for Koha

<br /><br />

## Q: What does jQuery have to do with Koha?

Koha uses SQL for custom reports.  To create a custom report in the Koha staff client, click on __*Reports*_, then __*Create from SQL*__.

## Q: What can you do with a custom report that you can't do with one of the built-in reports in Koha?

The Statistics wizard, Top lists, Inactive, Other reports, and reports made with the "Create guided report" tool can do a lot, but they have limitations.  Particularly the "Created guided report" tool.  That tool only offers you a handful of database tables that you can work with and what you can do with them.  Custom reports allow you to base reporst on any data saved anywhere in the Koha database.

## Q: What does "SQL" stand form

SQL stands for Structured Query Language.  

A librarian way of thinking about it is that it's a controlled vocabulary for asking the database reference questions.
